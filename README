Let's do this:
- Using jquery & AJAX, display a list of compliments from the API (currently at /comps relative to the index page)
- Using Jquery and AJAX, write a simple form to add a new compliment and display it in the list

Bonus round!
- Prevent blank entries
- Display one compliment (new endpoint)
- delete compliments
